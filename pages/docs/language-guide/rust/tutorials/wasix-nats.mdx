# WASIX with NATS

## Introduction

This is a tutorial on how to connect to a NATS server from WASIX. We'll be using the [async-nats](https://crates.io/crates/async-nats) crate to connect to the NATS server.

NATS is a simple, secure and high performance open source messaging system for cloud native applications, IoT messaging, and microservices architectures.

NATS features:

- Publish/Subscribe: Basic messaging pattern that allows one-to-many communication.
- Request/Reply: Enables synchronous communication by sending a request and waiting for a reply.
- Fault Tolerance: Provides built-in mechanisms to handle system failures.
- High Throughput: Designed for high performance, with minimal latency.
- Security: Can be configured for secure communication using TLS/SSL.

## Prerequisites

<CliVersionCallout />

The project requires the following tools to be installed on your system:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Wasmer](https://docs.wasmer.io/install)
- [WASIX](/docs/language-guide/rust/installation)
- [NATS Server](https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/installation)
- [NATS CLI](https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/nats-tools/nats_cli)

## Project Description

We‚Äôll be following [async_nats](https://docs.rs/async-nats/latest/async_nats/#complete-example) example from its official docs on crates.io.
This example demonstrates how to connect to a NATS server, subscribe to a subject, and publish messages to a subject.

<Steps>
### Project Setup

Let's create a new project with cargo.

```shell
$ cargo new --bin wasix-nats
    Created binary (application) `wasix-nats` package
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  The `nats-server.conf` also has **jetstream** enabled. JetStream is a
  high-performance datastore for NATS. It is designed to be the backing store
  for NATS Streaming, but is also directly accessible using the NATS API.
  <br />
  So, we create an empty directory for the jetstream data.
</Callout>

```shell
$ cd wasix-nats
$ mkdir jetstream
```

Your `wasix-nats` directory structure should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="wasix-nats" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="jetstream" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="main.rs" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name=".gitignore" />
    <FileTree.File name="Cargo.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Let's add the following dependencies to our `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml filename="Cargo.toml" copy
[dependencies]
tokio="1"
async-nats="0.31.0"
bytes="1.4.0"
futures="0.3.28"
```

### Writing the code

Let's write the basic NATS Publish and Subscribe.

```rust filename="src/main.rs"
// src/main.rs
use futures::StreamExt;

const PUBLISH_SUBJECT: &str = "wasix.messages.rust";  // üëàüèº subject to publish messages to
const SUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT: &str = "wasix.messages.cli"; // üëàüèº subject to subscribe to

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), async_nats::Error> {
    // Connect to the NATS server
    let client = async_nats::connect("127.0.0.1:4222").await?;
    println!("Connected to NATS server");

    // Subscribe to the "messages" subject
    let mut subscriber = client.subscribe(SUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT.into()).await?;

    // Publish messages to the "messages" subject
    for i in 0..10 {
        println!("Published message - before: {}", i);
        client
            .publish(PUBLISH_SUBJECT.into(), format!("Hello - {}", i).into())
            .await?;
        client.flush().await?; // üëàüèº flush the message to the server
        println!("Published message - after: {}", i);
    }

    // Receive and process messages
    while let Some(message) = subscriber.next().await {
        println!("Received message {:?}", message);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

The changes we made to the example code from `async_nats` are:

1. Creating a `PUBLISH_SUBJECT` and `SUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT` constants.

#### Testing the code

Let's test our code.

1. In a terminal run the NATS server.

```shell copy
$ nats-server -c nats-server.conf
```

2. In a second terminal subscribe to the subject `wasix.messages.rust` using the NATS CLI.

```shell copy
$ nats sub wasix.messages.rust
```

3. Now in another terminal run the code.

```shell
$ cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32s
     Running `target/debug/wasix-nats`
Connected to NATS server
Published message - before: 0
Published message - after: 0
Published message - before: 1
Published message - after: 1
Published message - before: 2
Published message - after: 2
Published message - before: 3
Published message - after: 3
Published message - before: 4
Published message - after: 4
Published message - before: 5
Published message - after: 5
Published message - before: 6
Published message - after: 6
Published message - before: 7
Published message - after: 7
Published message - before: 8
Published message - after: 8
Published message - before: 9
Published message - after: 9
```

You should see the messages being published in the terminal where you subscribed to the subject.

```shell
13:27:12 Subscribing on wasix.messages.rust
[#1] Received on "wasix.messages.rust"
Hello - 0

[#2] Received on "wasix.messages.rust"
Hello - 1

[#3] Received on "wasix.messages.rust"
Hello - 2

[#4] Received on "wasix.messages.rust"
Hello - 3

[#5] Received on "wasix.messages.rust"
Hello - 4

[#6] Received on "wasix.messages.rust"
Hello - 5

[#7] Received on "wasix.messages.rust"
Hello - 6

[#8] Received on "wasix.messages.rust"
Hello - 7

[#9] Received on "wasix.messages.rust"
Hello - 8

[#10] Received on "wasix.messages.rust"
Hello - 9

```

4. Now, let's try to publish messages from the NATS CLI.

```shell copy
$ nats pub wasix.messages.cli "Hello from NATS CLI"
```

You should see the message being received in the terminal where you ran the code.

```shell
Received message Message { subject: "wasix.messages.cli", reply: None, payload: b"Hello from NATS CLI", headers: None, status: None, description: None, length: 37 }
```

### WASIX Compatability

For adding **WASIX** support we need to pin and patch some dependencies in our `Cargo.toml` file. You can read more about this [here](../patched-repos).

```toml filename="Cargo.toml" copy
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "=1.24.2", git = "https://github.com/wasix-org/tokio.git", branch = "epoll", default-features = false, features = [
    "full",
] } # üëàüèº pinned to wasix fork
async-nats = { version = "0.31.0", git = "https://github.com/wasix-org/nats.rs.git", branch = "wasix" } # üëàüèº pinned to wasix fork
bytes = "1.4.0"
futures = "0.3.28"

[patch.crates-io]
tokio = { git = "https://github.com/wasix-org/tokio.git", branch = "epoll" } # üëàüèº patched to wasix fork
async-nats = { version = "0.31.0", git = "https://github.com/wasix-org/nats.rs.git", branch = "wasix" } # üëàüèº patched to wasix fork
```

#### Compiling the project to WASIX

```shell
$ cargo wasix build --release
...
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 26.73s
info: Post-processing WebAssembly files
  Optimizing with wasm-opt
```

#### Testing the code in WASIX

```shell
$ wasmer run target/wasm32-wasmer-wasi/release/wasix-nats.wasm --net
Connected to NATS server
Published message - before: 0
Published message - after: 0
Published message - before: 1
Published message - after: 1
Published message - before: 2
Published message - after: 2
Published message - before: 3
Published message - after: 3
Published message - before: 4
Published message - after: 4
Published message - before: 5
Published message - after: 5
Published message - before: 6
Published message - after: 6
Published message - before: 7
Published message - after: 7
Published message - before: 8
Published message - after: 8
Published message - before: 9
Published message - after: 9
```

**Works the same!**

You can also try to publish messages from the NATS CLI.

```shell copy
$ nats pub wasix.messages.cli "Hello to WASIX from NATS CLI"
```

You should see the message being received in the terminal where you ran the code.

```shell
Received message Message { subject: "wasix.messages.cli", reply: None, payload: b"Hello to WASIX from NATS CLI", headers: None, status: None, description: None, length: 46 }
```

#### Flags Information

- `--net` - enables networking support

To know more about the flags run `wasmer run --help`.

</Steps>

### ü§∏üèº Exercise Time

- Try to implement a NATS client streaming example with WASIX.
- Try to take message as input from the user and publish it to the NATS server.
- Try to take the subject as env variable from the user and publish/subscribe to that subject.

# Conclusion
